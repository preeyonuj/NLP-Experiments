Here, I have implemented a skipgram architecture in Tensorflow. I have used the text8 dataset, which containes sentence corpus from multiple wikipedia articles.
The code has been influenced by Priyanka Dwivedi's blog.
Here is the link to it: https://github.com/priya-dwivedi/Deep-Learning/blob/master/word2vec_skipgram/Skip-Grams-Solution.ipynb
